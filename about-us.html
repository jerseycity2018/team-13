<h2>
        <center><font size="5"><b>What we’ve learned these past four decades informs what we believe:</font></b></center>
</h2>
    <center><font size="4"><b>Conservation is about people and motivating them to behave differently.</font></b></center>

    <p align="center">
    
        <font size="4">Human behavior is the root cause of every major conservation and development challenge. Therefore, changing how people behave is the single most important thing we can do to ensure nature’s survival. Since people are emotional beings, we can leverage emotions—such as pride—to drive people toward action and unleash transformative change.</font>

    <h3>
        <center><font size="4"><b>The most pressing conservation challenges are local in nature but global in impact.</font></center></b>
    </h3>

    <p align="center">

        <font size="4">Nearly half of the world’s population (over 3 billion people) lives on less than $2.50 per day. The world’s poorest people depend on the world’s remaining forests, wetlands, and coral reefs to survive. Inspiring these communities to adopt new behaviors and practices that balance use and preservation requires a toolkit and mindset uncommon in conservation work.</font>
